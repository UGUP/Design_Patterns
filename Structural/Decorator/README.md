Decorator Design Pattern 

If we have a scenario where we add properties or
features to a base entity at runtime where final output depends 
on the output of the base consider decorator design pattern.
(Output depends on previous output)


if a class is both base and addon then
1) Add both parameterized Constructor and default Constructor.


Steps to Implement Decorator design Pattern 

1) Define an interface/abstract class
2) For each create a class that implements this interface
